Hi everyone!

Before the winter break I promised to get back to you all on how to pick
up where we left off.  Finally, here is the agenda for a series of three
workshops on Infix.

The idea is to have one workshop per month, with time in between to work
on the exercises.  Every workshop will be about 3h long and focus on one
topic.  We're aiming for end-of-day schedules, but please let us know if
you prefer early mornings instead.

After the first workshop we will take inventory of your needs setting up
your computer, or if we should set up a dedicated Linux server where you
can do the work.
